To evaluate on the Hadoop dataset, use `BERT4DAT_trainAndUse_v2` or the first version (`BERT4DAT_trainAndUse`). V3 is not stable (WIP).

You can use `BERT4DAT_eval` for 10-fold cross


`BERT4DAT_trainClassifier` can be used to simply train (and save) a classifier model (with the first version of the code). This model can be used with, e.g., `BERT4DAT_useClassifier`
